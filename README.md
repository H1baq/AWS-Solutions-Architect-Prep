# AWS Solutions Architect – Certification Prep

This repository documents my learning journey while preparing for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** certification.

It contains:
- Structured **study notes** aligned with AWS training modules
- **Hands-on labs** demonstrating practical AWS architecture skills
- **Diagrams and references** based on AWS best practices
- Exam-focused **cheat sheets and summaries**

The goal is to build a clear, practical, and evolving knowledge base that reflects real-world cloud architecture thinking — not just exam theory.
